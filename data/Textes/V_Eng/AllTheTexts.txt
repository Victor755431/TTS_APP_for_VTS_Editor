tm_8pshh05x7awu6vbx	For a few years, the Red Cross has been organising some trips to first aid stations in the region of Nairobi to bring some medicine. These trips can be hazardous, especially near the village of Ramatowa who is often at war with the neighboring village of Pazimanga.	"For a few years, the Red Cross has been organising some trips to first aid stations in the region of Nairobi to bring some medicine.
These trips can be hazardous, especially near the village of Ramatowa who is often at war with the neighboring village of Pazimanga."	APPRENANT		
tm_h8nmxqv19ldt9w6x		And that particular village is on the other side of the river from the preceding first aid station (Bamalowi). The Red Cross's truck need to drive up the river to the next bridge which is 19 miles North, and go down the river to Ramatowa. Once the drugs are distributed, the truck comes back to the bridge 30km to the North, and continues his journey West.	APPRENANT		
tm_bvbli8psn9emqnwh		This year, the local director of the Red Cross, Hubert Gramont, is asking himself how to optimize this journey, looking to reduce aggression risks and to avoid this long way around the river. The solution he retained would be to use a few drones able to lift one or two kilos and go accross the river with drugs. The members of the Ramatowa center could go pick up the medicines on the other side. He wants to put Isabelle Boucicaut on charge of the project, as she knows well the topology of the place and the inhabitants of every village, and she has the largest experience on the conduct of humanitarian projects.	APPRENANT		
tm_r08tnwhvh7zdyrc1		Hi Isabelle ! Come have a seat.	Hubert		
tm_8gre4kvtx68uyvr8		I asked you to come here to put you in charge of a mission.	Hubert		
tm_0iz9d386lwju25kg	You know, that little village of Ramatowa, who forces us to make a 36 miles detour, because it is on the other side of the Bamalowi river ?	You know, that little village of Ramatowa who forces us to make a 36 miles detour because it is right accross Bamalowi's river ?	Hubert		
tm_m1rovwlvkvfru350		Oh yes, I see.	Isabelle		
tm_1ggmq07a0j9me108		It's a shame there's no bridge closer !	Isabelle		
tm_ihhkffd5knflmlbm			Isabelle		
tm_kw8v6qxjamy8iz92		Listen. I thought about it, and I think we could make the situation better.	Hubert		
tm_uxo40zqarf2qr40h	We just need one or two powerful enough drones, that could carry the medicines accross the river to Ramatowa.	We just need one or two powerful enough drones that could carry the medicines accross the river to Ramatowa.	Hubert		
tm_hcflw54q7u0t65f5		The guys from the station pick them on the other side, and that's it !	Hubert		
tm_vwg897irypadwy8r		Do you imagine the economy of fuel and time ?	Hubert		
tm_jm7kyh5hdal998kk		Yes, the idea is interesting. But maybe, we should study a bit more closely the costs, and hoped benefits of such an operation ?	Isabelle		
tm_y14j0y25cadef2hb	But Isabelle, the economy is evident ! The truck takes two hours to drive the 36 miles, because the road is really horrendous.	But Isabelle, the economy is evident ! The truck takes two hours to drive the 36 miles because the road is really horrendous.	Hubert		
tm_263scxnxazg6jev7		Moreover, it burns 4 gallons of fuel to drive that distance.	Hubert		
tm_4m5nlebk7yho4xqc		We do this trip 12 times a year.	Hubert		
tm_wjb7ihwj75622sc5		This avoids us 24 hours of travel and would spare 48 gallons each year. 48 gallons is not negligeable, and this would mean at least 2 000 € spared each year.	Hubert		
tm_nr1uvt4od3eei3br		If we build 2 drones for less than 2000€ each, we will break even in 2 years.	Hubert		
tm_ji6toe2v231n6are		Yeah, you're probably right.	Isabelle		
tm_bty7ecxt7x6nh44d		According to you, are Hubert's points sufficients ? Is Isabelle wrong for arguing there ?	APPRENANT		
tm_4tcdn1xw7otjl43c	In every project, a cost/benefit study needs to be seriously made. Even if the direct benefits seem obvious at first glance, we need to evaluate precisely the costs and benefits, study the realisation strategies and the drawbacks. And never forget that benefits and drawbacks aren't always linked to money. They need to be linked with the company's strategy.	"In every project, a cost/benefit study needs to be seriously made.

tm_xvw2hvo8054mp24z		Allow me to insist. I'll look more closely at your idea.	Isabelle		
tm_v86f0hfe3pdzbb4e		OK Isabelle, I recognize you were right. Let's meet in 2 days to talk about it ?	Hubert		
tm_nj0q5y8oxpzpl2m7		This could work. Let's say Wednesday, after the team briefing ?	Isabelle		
tm_56g57kv2764gvqbk		That alright for me. Have a nice day !	Hubert		
tm_21wqgd00wt4ntbza		Have a nice day too !	Isabelle

tm_5d2jgott7qo4nvjf		I thougt about your idea.	Isabelle		
tm_hb49xuxp2jmllz59		And I have a better idea of what we could hope to achieve.	Isabelle		
tm_bdxwdpi9oz3ce2d2		In the costs, you seem to have forgotten about the batteries to charge and the time it will take to go accross the river with 16lbs of medicines.	Isabelle		
tm_i5khbj6vkl61300d		If every drone can carry 4lbs, you'll need to send them twice. So it will still take around 20 minutes, mostly to load and unload them.	Isabelle		
tm_m44kqc5ivyx1i1j3		So the benefit in time and cost will be less important.	Isabelle		
tm_8mn7jnhl813mfhiy		You're right, I didn't think about all of that.	Hubert		
tm_0wp4l82kultm4ct2		Do you estimate the project is still relevant ?	Hubert		
tm_j9zdghbl5w76sv00		Yes, but the development costs will probably be a bit higher, because we want to build our own drones to be able to repair them easily, and as rarely as possible.	Isabelle		
tm_os94gwg1zloi1ulm		And we will probably need a spare drone. We will also have to train the guys who do the runs.	Isabelle		
tm_v9s9w6uazy90f9e1		In a nutshell, I think we need to reevaluate the budget to at least 4 000 €, as indicated in the documents I printed you.	Isabelle		
tm_5dom4v1gom162o7w		So don't expect a break-even before five or six years.	Isabelle		
tm_w3r4tvl9b4rzu64k		Anyway, the financial benefit shouldn't be our priority.	Isabelle		
tm_vx19wlzbis9ppy09		On the other hand, a benefit we didn't talk about, and seems important to me because it's linked to our values is the welfare of our personnel.	Isabelle		
tm_b6ze0c3qq3omo6z0		This journey is very tiring, and every time everyone comes back exhausted.	Isabelle		
tm_be90wkgvch92cmgl		If we could avoid 2 hours of poor track, this would be an important benefit !	Isabelle		
tm_ltrrj9n1ggrfp7av		And there's the ecological aspect too : burning less fossil fuels is one of our engagements.	Isabelle		
tm_x55ewcgg9frwtd6l		Here, Isabelle took the time to study the benefits and costs linked to the strategic goals of the association !	APPRENANT		
tm_a7dwlwn7m1iksffr		I see you thought about every aspect. With these selling points, I'm OK for a 4000€ budget.	Hubert		
tm_ktgy3s250vnzwjme		So let's go ! You have six months, motivating isn't it ?	Hubert		
tm_7n0uuz3giqy28m05		Can the project start like that ? Do we have enough data to go ahead ?	APPRENANT		
tm_nxdbb9gss1cqojcd	We have to go through a new go/no-go step to get more precise border, some clear objectives and success criteria, consult all involved parties, define constraints and major risks, and to getan initial planification who identifies the expected deliverables, and the required activities to  produce them. For each activity, we also need to identify the required human resources and their availability. We also need to think about material resources associated with each activity. In a nutshell, we need a heap of elements to determine if the project is really doable, and to guarantee a success if it's the case.

tm_jdeyvdtc1jczpd7y		Sorry to curb your enthousiasm Hubert, I have a job to do.	Isabelle		
tm_kray55a7gryuiyio		Before starting, I also have a mission and a journey to Pali Wani to plan.	Isabelle		
tm_4qd1eooy4wd5m7rq		No problem, I'll send Magali instead. The drone project is a lot more urgent to me.	Hubert		
tm_dy3lh5o9nty0epg1		OK, but before starting, I'll have to make a more precise planification for the project, with clear goals and limits.	Isabelle		
tm_01i5cc9v5da0bixa		Then, you could decide if we go forward or not.	Isabelle		
tm_xvysfzrnjww3mwzf		And in the case we proceed forward, you'll need to name me responsible for that project so that everyone understands more clearly what's my role.	Isabelle		
tm_u2tjdvwu0ttn3g87		Moreover, I'd like to ask our system's engineer Marc Aurile to participate as soon as possible so that he could help me in the planification of the project.	Isabelle		
tm_enxxtudgz48fy73n		How many demands do you have ?	Hubert		
tm_tt75npzegug6oe39		Don't you also want an office with a coffee machine ?	Hubert		
tm_h0zvz2snesdz3v4l		I was thinking about it, but Marc Aurile will do just fine.	Isabelle		
tm_wqjnpbnsjk2mvr8l		OK, OK, fine. I'll tell him to come help you tomorrow morning.	Hubert		
tm_0hqrwnjzczzg7xmo		How much time do you need  to run this initial planifiaction phase ?	Hubert		
tm_1vsls6at6luvzkw2		Three weeks.	Isabelle		
tm_bnz16x3ntowonzo7		Three weeks ? That's way too much !	Hubert		
tm_c7eu8vse2e1ekwfg		Hubert's reaction seems justified : three weeks to produce some paperwork, is it really necessary ?	APPRENANT		
tm_igybkphf79jvvciy	The initial planification phase is often overlooked. It is nevertheless essential. It can make you win a lot of time down the road. It allows you to aim for some reachable objectives, to identify clearly what's every person's role, and their level of involvement about the project. It also identifies the difficult parts early on, and the major risks too. Involving an engineer very early is also necessary, because he will be the one giving the best estimations on what is doable or not, and on the time necessary to realize the technical parts.

tm_0dv8facxttk5468p		Yes, I really need that much time. I'm not an expert in drones, and Marc will have to  invest himself there.	Isabelle		
tm_b70gjg8rplobpdzq		And what will we include in this project ? Should we train two or three pilots ? Should the drones really carry every type of drugs ? I should also study the major risks linked to our project. What could prevent us from meeting the deadlines ?	Isabelle		
tm_6lns5mmiv10jluep		From staying in the allotted budget ? What could impact the quality of the service we try to put in place ?	Isabelle		
tm_348tsqtyururqyg5	There Isabelle makes the magic triangle of the project management appear : costs, quality, delays. A project manager always juggles with these three variables. If they change one of them, it generally impacts one or the other of these variables. For example,  reducing the delays could impact the quality of service and the cost. We could for exemple pay more to have everyone working at the same time to finish earlier...	"There Isabelle makes the magic triangle of the project management appear :

tm_tkprvv6ce8tx0kcq		I maintain that. You think I'm losing some time, but you'll see that it'll pay off on the long run.	Isabelle

tm_1syz3og4grjf2x7w		Oh, hi Marc ! Hubert probably talked to you about the drone project to carry the drugs from Bamalowi to Ramatowa ?	Isabelle

tm_yx32w93imzl0y169		Things are fine now.	Nurumbé		
tm_idypw0pqgtbu2nx5		We get our medicines every first monday each month, and they treat most diseases we have.	Nurumbé		
tm_cisvcrnz09p5uqt1		Yes, and that will go on.	Isabelle		
tm_75b77vodcuvryiw3		I wanted to discuss the way we deliver them.	Isabelle		
tm_fcnem5h8axx1ao93		You know, each time, we're forced to go upstream from Bamalowi to the Bisotu bridge to get to your village.	Isabelle		
tm_px3y5vd0fmf70xro		Yes, I know it's a long way around the river.	Nurumbé		
tm_43bpgciftwfr7s6b		Hubert thought about a new way to do it.	Isabelle		
tm_pf4ydehdv8keu3rq		The Pamalowi village is just accross the river.	Isabelle		
tm_ixyuhdmznkv2rmqj		We just need to get the medicines accross, and that will be done !	Isabelle		
tm_fl8ptmkioe2y6gu5		But how do you want to cross ?	Nurumbé		
tm_zioql8gxyx5mi0nb		Here the rapids are very fast, you know it's impossible to cross with a small boat !	Nurumbé		
tm_xtlboivkqfvsk4on		Yes, I know.	Isabelle		
tm_qog5foyohbdw5ume		Our idea was to use two or three drones to do the job.	Isabelle		
tm_y537sudchk2ccgf8		Drones ? Here ?	Nurumbé		
tm_w50r4dd45t50jhtf		Yes. Hubert is about to fund a project to build a few of these to do that job.	Isabelle		
tm_9f5lk1e5ma7fmxl0		I get that for you, it makes the journey a lot easier.	Nurumbé		
tm_y1pni9oel1qwc1x0		And the track to our village is uneasy.	Nurumbé		
tm_1uf2amm1k0ael5u3		But for us, there isn't much interest !	Nurumbé		
tm_2i74jp5varhrpt5l		Except for the children who will love it.	Nurumbé		
tm_b4elbmbh20mcnzv5		Don't forget that we always await you each month.	Nurumbé		
tm_vdtgu921un09tevh		You bring some fresh air in our everyday lives, you give us fresh news from the capital, you chat with the children and the elderly to see if they're fine.	Nurumbé		
tm_dzlsb2qv9nvvdgxw		All of that would be gone !	Nurumbé		
tm_5x543df845vg4lny		That's true. I didn't think about it...	Isabelle		
tm_yy25xudkvgzx1gsh		On the other hand, as time goes on, you always stop for a shorter time. Last time, Jacques was in a hurry, and the team only stayed an hour !	Nurumbé		
tm_7b4xh5rnfsrkf6i0		Yes, Jacques told me, but he had an important meeting with an association to discuss new solar panel equipments.	Isabelle		
tm_qfr4m754xtfjl72b		Yes, each time there's a good excuse.	Nurumbé		
tm_x6lkhzyj0wd6dg5d		Enough, it doesn't matter anymore as you won't even come to see us !	Nurumbé		
tm_32meq5g3py4iruu9		Stop being a drama-king Nurumbé.	Isabelle		
tm_bmh6ud48t32qhsfi		Let's try to think together.	Isabelle		
tm_570bf7k056m80hfj		Why couldn't you switch ?	Nurumbé		
tm_ldppq378zg4zy9ao		You could take the Pituru bridge downstream and come visit us ?	Nurumbé		
tm_41nt6tg5v4ymvgi6		You could even fly your drones from here !	Nurumbé		
tm_qp1l2l2nkquwhpk3		Well, it could be a solution, but now that you told me you need communication with the village population, we're probably going to have the same problem with the Pamalowi village.	Isabelle		
tm_1ti8hpn2lnx1gnl0		Let's think...	Isabelle		
tm_ekxrme9wsybvrczk		And if we chose some middle ground ?	Isabelle		
tm_aa6yp3vbpg9k0x8o		We could come here once every two months ?	Isabelle

tm_dei5nlcu1y5ymm31		Yes, that would be better.	Nurumbé		
tm_zpgvpdbo2gxorra4		But tell me, what are you really trying to do here ?	Nurumbé		
tm_xh86fil1nse62hgn		Gain some time, or avoid getting too tired by reducing driving times ?	Nurumbé		
tm_7v0jsey9ojimqt5k		A bit of both to be honnest.	Isabelle		
tm_x2qq5oskhr4yhc47		Our teams always come back exhausted after these runs !	Isabelle		
tm_lj3eaj4889z6hc3h		Well, if time isn't the issue, why not also stay a bit longer each time you go ?	Nurumbé		
tm_41vfxo44nqndo6jf		If you stayed here for three hours, the inhabitants would see a real improvement !	Nurumbé		
tm_1jqnjmsh0df9j23r		They would be able to discuss a bit more about their health issues.	Nurumbé		
tm_pmetlq5pmggt53no		We'll think about it, but it looks like a good compromise.	Isabelle		
tm_s37dgmgnlavdl8lt		I'll talk about it with my teams.	Isabelle		
tm_t5jlwmswwf7fes0s		And let's stop talking about business !	Isabelle		
tm_fxavrgbuhko9936x		Are your cooking skills still sharp ?	Isabelle		
tm_5buwlxzgxmezrhjj		Ah, I see the travel sharpened your appetite.	Nurumbé		
tm_jk1zk2pcm4df0415		Don't worry.	Nurumbé		
tm_uu541ndjnrbyup0k		As soon as I learned you'd come, I cooked you a nice spicy meal.	Nurumbé

tm_njh0ywkseqosx0h6		And so you'd agree with this new way of delivering once by drone, and the other time with our truck ?	Isabelle		
tm_6eirwit5rantaayv		Yes Isabelle. As you said.	Gérard		
tm_zb0clpcx9djsb089		And if you stayed an hour more once every two months, it'll be perfect.	Gérard		
tm_qad7765oy3mbrfoi		Also, your idea gave me a new one.	Gérard		
tm_efekxxjn0p33rusp		We could maybe use the system to trade with Ramatowa. They have spices that we can't grow here, and in exchange, we could send them some sandals or leather belts that we make here.	Gérard		
tm_v3fzei8o1eshnpxb		Could the drones carry this ?	Gérard		
tm_wef1g9xnqu1nnoof		That wasn't really planned, but why not ?	Isabelle		
tm_1a50f64hq5mrio07		I don't think the drone will be able to lift a heavier weight than two or maybe four pounds, but it could be done.	Isabelle		
tm_xz3nna94ev8mmwo7		The real problem is that our drones have a limited autonomy.	Isabelle		
tm_lc0s2v7srby5ji8w		We risk to not have enough batteries for that.	Isabelle		
tm_24j3y7xz1915iq3f		And why not use our solar panels ?	Gérard		
tm_87bz72u1lsvjq373		We could maybe charge them on our car battery charger ?	Gérard		
tm_61wuiackvns7fmk7		Do you think it'll work ?	Isabelle		
tm_16oj2ha345nbntrv		We're going to have to study the question.	Isabelle		
tm_cxkvv2xf0tcajx9r		And while you're at it, it would be great if my nephew Edouard could pilot one.	Gérard		
tm_tmse58nry6a07fno		 He's passionated about drones, and he is a bit of a local celebrity.	Gérard		
tm_j106siw07c345ib3		Oh oh, I see you're already onboard the project.	Isabelle		
tm_356xf0a8jhsziqwh		But did he already pilot some drones ?	Isabelle		
tm_p32umc6y6uszpu1h		He bought a little quadcopter that he uses to gather the animals.	Gérard		
tm_3uhv02z37ptacul4		But of course, it's probably much smaller that the ones you're going to build.	Gérard		
tm_ajcvu5lqwmdcuvl2		Yes of course.	Isabelle		
tm_4y77ssqrh043d8us		So we're gonna have to train him with our teams.	Isabelle		
tm_sxxmwfl197bborey		I'll see if I can arrange this.	Isabelle		
tm_hjqz51xvu0hjtxl1		And maybe give him a handbook ?	Gérard		
tm_avjy3gzat3uioxak		So that he could read it before going to the training.	Gérard		
tm_kdzaqnnbw0kg799h		OK. I take note of that too.	Isabelle		
tm_y73ftscu4jq4agdx		Let's check the river to see where we could use your drones to exchange ?	Gérard		
tm_51ya6qk6k90p1q9w		That's a really good idea.	Isabelle		
tm_gvwufzpuj358dakj		Isabelle seems to agree with everything. Is this the right attitude ?	APPRENANT

tm_3a1xzpt3vkbexohx		Here is the perfect spot. The river is a bit narrower than everywhere else, and there's already a pontoon to land your drone on the other side.	Gérard		
tm_3rwlx64jc3n6cidr		Ah, that's quite a thing to see.	Isabelle		
tm_3cad25a9dtcvuol2		I didn't imagine the river was that large, and thought the rapids were less powerful !	Isabelle		
tm_n4ny93aaoyf2aixs		Nature is wild here.	Gérard		
tm_lukusdpx8r9tp7k4		Sometimes, we can't even see the other bank because it gets quite foggy here.	Gérard		
tm_ulpbfv2fku7ra2ck		And that fog is almost unpredictable.	Gérard		
tm_yhr643wq29po8yr0			Gérard		
tm_smpccysvbtkym8wt		Do you mean it could interfere with our navigation and we can lose sight of the drone ?	Isabelle		
tm_tvz3s8xlllutedth		Well, it would be better to avoid these days, because it'll surely be more difficult.	Gérard		
tm_r0y2mvwzzqgqnbda		I see that, but when we programm a run, we can't modify it because of the fog.	Isabelle		
tm_jpmroxspxmx31ylg		In that case, you'd better find a solution to know where your drone is, and to make it land on the other side. The Eastern bank is half a mile away.	Gérard		
tm_5v6y4iqyc7utgrfh		I see.	Isabelle		
tm_tx2bl9nrvo1wei78		I need to talk about that to Marc, our system engineer.	Isabelle		
tm_diydkriw0xdenkp1		Maybe a camera or a GPS could do the trick !	Isabelle		
tm_xive1shji76e25xo		Your drone is going to get expensive !	Gérard		
tm_90r8uyzjkk8jjktq		Maybe Marc will have a cheaper solution.	Isabelle		
tm_b6u1kp6qk9ok1ygk		Anyway, I'm going to tell him about this issue.	Isabelle

tm_7k1x0srjrgkofdi3		Hello you all !	Isabelle		
tm_rjiwvmxladd5ufah		Hello Isabelle !	Émilie		
tm_lj4bw4n56wmzbjf4		You've been called here to discuss a new project.	Isabelle		
tm_sfy9h7k820uq6p4u		A new project ?	Mathieu		
tm_yd70p044sjxx2xi3		You know, for us each run is a project in itself.	Mathieu		
tm_b4h23bcygqe4kc5l		Well, that one's goal is to make your journey East easier. You know, the one in which you drive 40 miles to get to a village on the other side of a river ?	Isabelle		
tm_l70e9wcw9kqvwd2f		Yes, the Ramatowa village, right accross Pamalowi !	Odile		
tm_j3grup48xj9j0rj5		This part is a pain. And the path is horrible with a lot of potholes !	Bruno		
tm_cgqzhjs6gf04g4jv		What's your project ?	Émilie		
tm_unym9zhflb778srl		The project isn't exactly mine, Hubert was the one to launch it.	Isabelle		
tm_fsqagkx9q2gut36n		Oh, the idea must be quite good !	Bruno		
tm_k51pbqeipfbevods		It's not that bad actually.	Isabelle		
tm_qvg1wu77jhi3z7oz		Come on, tell us !	Odile		
tm_4sqo9848ywzefxyi		Well, instead of going around for 40 miles, Hubert suggested using two drones to carry the medicines from one side to the other.	Isabelle		
tm_eh0mem3zwtw3ww7y		Well, that's a great innovation !	Émilie		
tm_rmd3jaj911da9vyp		But how big would such a drone need to be to do that ?	Mathieu		
tm_evlkteoic32p5yt4		No idea, I'll have to ask Marc.	Isabelle		
tm_xbmj2te4r91v4mey		Is Marc also onboard ?	Odile		
tm_toyutucrqh4zqayr		Yes, he's tasked with the system development part.	Isabelle		
tm_mpi9oyir1m8z5lie		Ah, I start to believe a bit more in your project !	Bruno		
tm_yrds2avqkw7vwhb8		You know that our trucks have little room on the back.	Mathieu		
tm_u9m7ztlhb8trtczq		They're already full of medicines and of our stuff.	Mathieu		
tm_opa2bcv837df4ho7		Yes, I'm aware of that.	Isabelle		
tm_ytzxdjzy2d3sk3lp		How much room would you have in the worse case scenario ?	Isabelle		
tm_avi9xiazdre7j99y		Well, I think a 20 inch square box could fit in there.	Bruno		
tm_5b0e5syvenah5wx0		What do you think you guys ?	Bruno		
tm_afnjzu09s4gn1wy8		Yes, and maybe a bit more.	Odile		
tm_fby7smv9dhbq5tbe		My concern is that the drone must be resistant, because the road is far from calm.	Odile		
tm_o7h080q9onsxqdbr		I'd say it's often like a rodeo !	Odile		
tm_e6xnm826ss0j0nsv		And boxes often fall on one another.	Mathieu		
tm_owxq0rd7dsitm79p		The box will need to be sturdy, and the drone well fixed inside.	Mathieu		
tm_x94ezc4xvmskc69w		OK, requirements acknowledged.	Isabelle		
tm_k25mc5zfhlo4t41u		The drone must fit in a 20 inches box.	Isabelle		
tm_ydajawu9uzq1qy3w		It must be secured fix in the box.	Isabelle		
tm_mngq4ruywwnddwm2		That box must be solid and resist shocks with other boxes.	Isabelle		
tm_wzpcsn2u4n5mmrx2		Well, the transport problem is solved, but who's going to pilot them ?	Bruno		
tm_4wrngjklij39vyva		I don't know anything about these things !	Bruno		
tm_pirzakvq3u80vnjy		Well, no problem for me if it's a classical drone. Like one with four rotors.	Émilie		
tm_y6oa26r06yburcx3		I followed a training when I was a student at the ENAC.	Émilie		
tm_5a3zwuhou7vtnlxu	"They taught me how to pilot them in a place called the ""volière""."	"They taught me how to pilot them in a place called the ""<b>Volière</b>""."	Émilie		
tm_luung5alr23rwbv9		It's the biggest indoor drone space in Europe.	Émilie		
tm_h975vgkx58oyras1		So, it looks like we're saved.	Bruno		
tm_04h2ny2v40djpi7u		Not so quickly. You all need basic notions to pilot them.	Isabelle		
tm_mkgbkk0lr8dl9v4r		But apparently Emilie can help you, and worst case scenario, we pay you some training sessions.	Isabelle		
tm_5ynrsmpnkzn7uy2k		A training ?	Bruno		
tm_vv1dzr0me4xv78jf		But I don't want no training !	Bruno		
tm_n6r4ampxd95l6360		I'll be able to sort it out myself.	Bruno		
tm_7902q6oudwmh52pu		OK, OK, we'll talk about it later.	Isabelle		
tm_13p07uvuejvosqgy		But is the idea fine with you ?	Isabelle		
tm_21qk09evc1x0pkxs		Definitely yes !	Odile		
tm_qwn0fj7ie2q22fv5		Do you think we're not going to take an opportunity to avoid 40 miles of track, and 3 hours of tiring driving ?	Odile		
tm_8yrfq588j80m7ghz		But I don't understand how Ramatowa's inhabitants accepted that.	Émilie		
tm_bl0f7zi1w9aynpqi		Won't we ever see them ?	Émilie		
tm_d68xj8pguf1n7fyq		Good question !	Isabelle		
tm_mj8k2vf289z2zca1		I went to discuss with the two village's chiefs.	Isabelle		
tm_mga64jqytghhwjyg		Nurumbé suggested we go in one village every two months.	Isabelle		
tm_gkptbe7lcpyajacp		And Gérard seems also fine with it.	Isabelle		
tm_t5nocu68ba825i5r		And doing that, you could stay a bit longer in each village when you visit them, to perform mini medical consultations.	Isabelle		
tm_mtpr3vqg573y0a4b		I largely prefer caring for sick children instead of being thrown around in that goddamn truck. It has some really bad shock absorbers !	Mathieu		
tm_eeml4ia4bfzc0r94		Ah, and Gérard had another condition : could you let his nephew pilot the drone and exchange some little stuff with Ramatowa ?	Isabelle		
tm_gx0pe4i4xwqevl5w		What is this little stuff ?	Odile		
tm_df453t89xzzxtdgl	Some sandals, leather belts, spice bags, etc	Some sandals, leather belts, spice bags,...	Isabelle		
tm_t8d3sivfqqouz96g		You mean we're going to watch some flying bartering ?	Mathieu		
tm_f0p658jbvdq3kxew		Yes ! And the nephew seems to be a good pilot.	Isabelle		
tm_yujpjjmm9pt3o71z		Maybe he could give you a few tips !	Isabelle		
tm_zaxzwu44xqk82egj		Well, that's going to make our run a bit more interesting. I'm curious about what that show will look like !	Odile		
tm_o2sqb19u0wespnma		So you're all onboard ?	Isabelle		
tm_gd802wrr6d0xjlh6		Yes !	Émilie		
tm_n7a4i8f91fgp0iex	He asked John and Matilde to come help him in his first brainstorming.	He asked John and Mathilde to come help him in his first brainstorming.	APPRENANT		
tm_b18s16oyuwskcdi4		So let's go. First of all, we need to set the limits of our system.	Marc		
tm_8mfewpn3gykq9m9k		What are the elements it is going to interact with ? What is its main mission ?	Marc		
tm_jzdlebpqkxxg68xt		It seems that its mission is to carry safely a pack of medicines accross the Ubangi river.	Mathilde		
tm_zgn6xneves8smg2z		Yes, it seems right, but I think we could be a bit more precise on the distance. I looked it up on Google maps.	Marc		
tm_eph5ztzl5xamizds		The river near Bamalowi half a mile. With safety margins, we could say 0.6 miles.	Marc		
tm_swcnf9j47qgnftcl		In that case, shouldn't we also precise the maximum weight of the medicines to carry ?	John		
tm_gk7gytvstm8fp5fa		You're 100% right. These two elements are essential to dimension the system.	Marc		
tm_yuin9uij2edgy63d		So let's say two pounds ?	Marc		
tm_sy0xo8preervsko5		Yes. We're going to have to check that with the distribution team, but that looks reasonnable.	John		
tm_e6axa099gxc1j2ey		So, our mission would be :	Marc		
tm_v6oqfyuw9wanh374	Airlift a two pounds pack of medicines over a distance of three fifth of a mile.	"<b>Airlift a two pounds pack of medicines over a distance of three fifth of a mile.""</b>"	Marc		
tm_kgtg7bc668b193fi		Is that OK with you ?	Marc		
tm_gnzfduorx8fhr3ad		Perfect.	Mathilde		
tm_hcdjf7q4fuzk69b7		The start of a functionnal analysis of a system always starts by identifying its operationnal mission.	APPRENANT		
tm_nr15bcldmt4xmmrd		Now let's address the limits of our system.	Marc		
tm_6mw90t5hkp2pgt41		With what and who is it going to interact ?	Marc		
tm_cz668fj0ycev99t1		This would allow us to define the principal functions and the constraints.	Marc		
tm_rbmqw72iuxe97qbp		The most obvious actors seem to be the pilot, the medicine pack, and the guy from Ramatowa who is going to unload the pack.	Mathilde		
tm_2ne8wde70aakwe53		Yes, but I doubt about the direct interaction with the pilot. We'll see this later.	Marc		
tm_7m694au5kmcwwyyx		Maybe the pilot won't be in charge of loading the pack aboard the drone. Maybe we need to identify a second guy in Bamalowi to load it on the drone ?	John		
tm_vacn9ud3y44ri6hd		Yes, it seems a great idea.	Marc		
tm_zwbxezezkyhr7ne5		So I think we have all the actors who will interact with the system.	Marc		
tm_2ir0qujkvj7ssai8		Do you see any factors that will add constraints ?	Marc		
tm_n90xl8hki1vbev2b		Climatic elements like wind and sun will probably play a role ?	Mathilde		
tm_z9rx99en6iqjpf23		Yes, we'll think about it. Anything else ?	Marc		
tm_0bmr6pyns6wucmxb		The river may have an impact, but if all goes well, it shouldn't interact !	John		
tm_l8sn3k6jil9oyxsc		We'll have to develop that in the safety study. I think we have more or less every actors. I'd add the landform of the take off fields.	Marc		
tm_fxwag987ngvh1kon		It plays an important role with ground/air interactions when the propellers start to lift the drone off the ground.	Marc		
tm_cdnsfhhm8xezln4s		Yeah, good idea !	Mathilde		
tm_dck7mk1uamjvkieq		Let's get back to the actors and see how they interract with the system.	Marc		
tm_lqeym32ideu7eyau		For the pilot, it seems obvious. He guides the drone to the other bank.	John		
tm_oi1dkow9sxbcxum7		Is this that obvious ? What would he need to guide the drone ?	Marc		
tm_qgt576j4x2rz7gwg		A telecommand, why ?	John		
tm_k2wraqabecunt6ob		There's the problem !	Marc		
tm_m6ofuffwn5n45440		Should we consider the remote control in the system ? If so, yes, the pilot directly interracts with it.	Marc		
tm_xxaxrirbwf1gqsee		Or should we exclude the remote from the system, and then it would be the remote that guides the system, not the pilot !	Marc		
tm_6amtew3yh9p2wsfv		Why would you exclude the remote control from the system ?	Mathilde		
tm_h8gnezoyf6xfpdyy		Well, it's mainly linked with costs, competency, and flexibility with the pilot.	Marc		
tm_hqvyl2rpru442hgm		I do not want to be responsible for guiding the drone from the ground.	Marc		
tm_et88ram9d54phpxp		Today, we could find some cheap radio remotes ont the Internet, with an excellent reach.	Marc		
tm_dl33ii6yjhrca289		We don't really have the competencies to developp this thing, and it will definitely be more expensive to develop than to buy it. And the results won't be better.	Marc		
tm_r1r0kaz1ub9bz2ty		So we could consider that this element is out of the system and we subcontract it elsewhere.	Marc		
tm_avuikhybhwgypfxd		In that case, we become dependent on a external builder, but at least, the pilot could choose a remote and configure it as he pleases.	Marc		
tm_9u116u4dngs3jfa8	Here Marc is touching an important point of functionnal analysis : Defining the limits of the system that we want to develop. Several considerations have to taken into account : costs, safety, competency, etc These latter will impact the functionnal limits of the sytem who will be smaller or bigger.	"Here Marc is touching an important point of functionnal analysis :

Several considerations have to taken into account :
* <b>costs,</b>
* <b>safety</b>,
* <b>competency</b>,...

These latter will impact the functionnal limits of the sytem who will be smaller or bigger."	APPRENANT		
tm_t36iub1wzj4jdamj		Yes, but will our system obey to emitted orders ?	John		
tm_k9rv6ttpsrhde8y4		Nice point !	Marc		
tm_akvazm0c1abf0hqq		Luckily, today, the radio transmitters come with a little box to put in the drone.	Marc		
tm_3fxy5kkk2bnufzqd		We just have to choose which receptors to be compatible with, and the job is done !	Marc		
tm_8em1cntaglu5ej2v		Yes, but are we sure the signal will be in the receptor's domain ?	Mathilde		
tm_ivvmhn2yg3hl0m8i		That's another good question Mathilde.	Marc		
tm_yi0c7sbwhwrebwmw		Our system will have to include a calibration function to adapt with the remote's frequency.	Marc		
tm_6xirmf35p59cn0lx		So we already two main functions for our system :	Marc		
tm_rjc16n1x42rxx09q	FP1 : Accept the guidance signals of the remote to move in the air like the pilot commands to do.	FP1 : <b>Accept the guidance signals of the remote to move in the air like the pilot commands to do.</b>	Marc		
tm_wgabtat370um1iba	FP2 : Calibrate the receptor on the the remote.	FP2 : <b>Calibrate the receptor on the the remote.</b>.	Marc		
tm_st6o4h4rc1zguw7j		Though FP2 looks moe like a constraint to me.	Marc		
tm_3v55207cwyurdtwh		Why ?	Mathilde		
tm_auw54g87li6ofhic		Because it only links the remote and the system.	Marc		
tm_unpdjfdp57gz0wsf		Yes, that's true. What else ?	Mathilde		
tm_07kfaapxervkvsca		Well, we're going to have to move the medicine pack. This looks like a main function.	John		
tm_susw5qe9yuhkohg6		And that's another constraint.	Marc		
tm_uzoypg6yx0epohr2		The sytem needs to be able to lift two pounds !	Marc		
tm_sv541rxojkz2v6x1		While we're at it, the system needs to allow the guy in charge to attach the pack easily and safely.	Mathilde		
tm_fp32rpon3d2bihpe		OK, that is a new main function. So we add :	Marc		
tm_s752aba7yxq0ttk1	FC2 : Lift and carry two pounds of medicines links the system and the medicines.	FC2 : <b>Lift and carry two pounds of medicines links the system and the medicines.</b>	Marc		
tm_6ymfgefm4l5ygp7n	FP2 : Attach strongly and easily 2 pounds of medicines links the the guy in charge and the medicines through the system.	FP2 : <b>Attach strongly and easily 2 pounds of medicines links the the guy in charge and the medicines through the system.</b>	Marc

tm_i2muwow3g0jqjwzv		So, what have you found in your functionnal analysis ?	Isabelle		
tm_ljk2ijrvq831dm7w		We defined two main functions and two constraint functions.	Marc		
tm_hjf9m6niriu4u7p5	The first main function is : Move through the air following the remote's orders.	"The first main function is : ""<b>Move through the air following the remote's orders</b>"""	Marc		
tm_s6t3g7j3cjxrt7kh		Seems relevant.	Isabelle		
tm_aolynwy1f24r01yu	The second one is : Allow the guy in charge in the village to attach a medicine pack quickly and safely.	"The second one is : ""<b>Allow the guy in charge in the village to attach a medicine pack quickly and safely.</b>"""	Marc

tm_7kh4bz46p7wca0bh		Nice start !	Isabelle		
tm_u5nzjy6l5jkwwpmj		From what I've seen in the field, we will have to add a few constraints.	Isabelle		
tm_dqi9q8dd5bcnvcww		For Gérard, the river can be very foggy.	Isabelle		
tm_z49urb1taybp3upu		So we should be able to use the drone, even if we don't se it.	Isabelle		
tm_24f1e57bebdif5p7		"For the guys who do the runs, the drone should be stored in a 20"" crate, and that crate should resist other boxes falling on it."	Isabelle		
tm_35jjp7kc7r9w8x6w		The truck will probably shake it quite a lot.	Isabelle		
tm_r6wcks027d5732hu		We will add these three functions.	Marc		
tm_eapkvfsrfjwqz7w5		Maybe we should also put a precision criteria for the landing ?	Isabelle		
tm_6mr7hwat3duir0pn		Something like three feets ?	Isabelle		
tm_g6umqzxwhqk4vni7		Precision is a value critera for the FP1 function.	Marc		
tm_4eg03on0nfc47gnb		I will add it too.	Marc		
tm_7f42nk4sjoebfwi5		Any other point ?	Marc		
tm_x772mvxo41ugwsna		No, I think I've told all th eideas I had.	Isabelle		
tm_kdoblejvg4ghg774		In this case, I'm back to my analysis.	Marc		
tm_qgb2jl0bqla1pdx3		Marc just entered Isabelle's office.	APPRENANT		
tm_zqp0raiv774boxsb		Hello Marc !	Isabelle		
tm_m7waztppfsl2jp91		So our first specifications sheet is ready ?	Isabelle		
tm_m6c3aijdi2fkij68		Do you think we will need to run some safety studies ?	Marc		
tm_vnq5nz3bcvw3538h		There isn't much risk with a single drone.	Isabelle		
tm_6spir03q5yfs63xj		These studies can also be lengthy and blow up our budget.	Isabelle		
tm_7u7nnzzwwiuzde7f		Yes, you're maybe right...	Marc		
tm_x4vm6k6qqw9kfwiv	Choose what Marc will say :	<b>Choose what Marc will say </b>:	APPRENANT		
tm_34adt9cct4rh0802		So let's forget about it.	Marc		
tm_4cv77sv5wtrsj56n		But please, allow me to do a short one.	Marc		
tm_q7ggaa0c8k5kytlq		The drone will cost us 500€, and if we can avoid amaging it with a small saftey analysis, I think it could be worth doing it.	Marc		
tm_bjhrivmkmaxgelxl		We will limit ourselves to the most critical elements.	Marc		
tm_ktjol3hwip9827hf		What do you tgink about this ?	Marc		
tm_z75vci90mdxnfyg6		OK, OK, let's do a small safety analysis.	Isabelle		
tm_evi5bwcy1p3ooe19		OK, I'm going ahaead with it.	Marc

yes, if they had thought about the technical solutions that could be deployed to prevent or answer to the initial event.

tm_2kxh1pzk6gegke5n		Marc and his team have resumed their brainstorming.	APPRENANT		
tm_8fjue8y0iqx8agay		So, we have identified some main functions and some constraints on our system.	Marc		
tm_nl8d1enog9zsmlsb		Now, let's try to focus on the safety analysis, and identify the actors that might interfere with it.	Marc		
tm_qivyh67gf12huste		The river was listed previously, and I think this is an idea worth considering.	Marc		
tm_v9h2rpog5tbrrdja		Yes, we should protect both the electronics and the medicines.	John		
tm_ecwm4w5lc1fas47k		Water must be kept away from these elements	John		
tm_mjxgaetwb2z3cnz9		Good point !	Marc		
tm_ous5bxcwfqx9y9xl		That adds two constraint functions.	Marc		
tm_mhw7mcichjaf1tsw		While we're talking about falling down, maybe the drone should resist small impacts wth the ground in case the pilot makes minor mistakes ?	Mathilde		
tm_3yv72mim21pr82nj		Piloting makes me think about something else.	John		
tm_hin1kvkzr5pgefh0		Last time I tried to buil da remote controlled circuit, my system was picking up signals from another source, and was acting randomly.	John		
tm_8n1rdxe4q8iqyawo		Not all at the same time, please.	Marc

tm_g1qx8ytrtb7qqxnl		Marc and Isabelle meet around a good cup of coffee.	APPRENANT		
tm_c1yv6lu01971qx7d		So, did your safety analysis go well ?	Isabelle		
tm_tn8hsy95ovo8qqbp		Yes, we thought about several chains of events to prevent.	Marc		
tm_gdhcyzu8e3h0oi9g		But thinking about it, I was wondering if we should considering cybersecurity aspects ?	Marc		
tm_gu54026x4kcgv9cx		What are you talking about ?	Isabelle		
tm_2pxj1nlaplcrvbxs		Do you fear our drone might get pirated ?	Isabelle

tm_ler5y7ya30vo477s		Yes, mostly to not have regret if an easily preventable attack happens.	Marc		
tm_a2by4kkh950k1ra8		OK, but please don't spend too much time on this, otherwise these studies will explode our budget.	Isabelle		
tm_i7n7t7a2vjsje9l6		"As told in the beginning, Ramatowa is often in conflict with a neighbouring village.

One of the inhabitants of this village heard about the drone project, asked a few questins about the communications with the remote, bought th esame model.

He got on the river banks during the tests, and took control of the drone. He picks it up, and runs away."	APPRENANT		
tm_1bxhcgbd91cyfofb		Heck ! Our drone got stolen.	Isabelle		
tm_0dgj4pu3deikfcc7		Of course, we didn't implement any protectionon the communications.	Marc		
tm_3k7bh5gb6v5eifg5		Not even some encryption of the command signal.	Marc		
tm_m2r5fbz9gzpcaubp		So any mildly competent pirate was able to take control of our drone.	Marc

tm_4yymm7rd32adsjl6		But where are these drones coming from ?	Alice		
tm_27s3iksc6kp6kddb		We will build them ourselves.	Isabelle		
tm_ag6syqprvksu0d8o		Did you think about the environmental impact ?	Alice		
tm_iy6dhvnr70qazoo3		Drones can be really noisy, and from what I heard, they need lots of batteries...	Alice		
tm_oxmbh4gaw3h76m4u		But where do this environmantalist concern come from ?	Isabelle		
tm_kuvbcmw4yht60e1r		Mostly from our teachers. They're getting more sensitive to ecologic concerns, and they use every occasion they get to talk about it.	Alice		
tm_0f9fh89ac1v9rbl8		This morning, our system conception teacher made a class on ecological conception.	Alice

tm_hiannypsq8e4b56j		To answer a loss of signal, I'd say we could solve it with some software.	Marc		
tm_kr12tzznyhc4l0a1		The drone will basically home in to a predefined point, if it can not detect any control signals.	Marc		
tm_ojtueezd1rvs8len		To answer a fall in the river, we should probably reinforce the structure, and make th edrone waterproof, but where to stop ?	Marc		
tm_8epbgqx3ds3wf6h0		We need to reach a compromise between making the drone as light as possible, and protect the motors, rotors, and medicines.	Marc

tm_o5rljsi6tagb45kl		If we want to get another security level, and be able to recover the drone more easily, we have to add the FC8 and FC9 constraints.	Isabelle		
tm_pdkiuwqlwmsiz21j		This implies the development or purchase of an Android app to track th edrone on a map.	Isabelle		
tm_b1kox6cvvxukvqxt		We will also have to programm some more on the drone, and add a GPS tracker in it.	Isabelle		
tm_6s872f08bzfcvyw6		We need 800 € to do that.	Isabelle		
tm_8gndsz1wopu24qo8		For the functions regarding protection against piracy, we could solve it by encrypting the communications, the estimated cost is rather low at 200 €.	Isabelle		
tm_xhdokto87qpqhif1		For the environmental impact, we could mostly buy recyclable batteries, and the wooden structure described higher.	Isabelle		
tm_mnexmaxjzx7bqa6j		The estimated added cost is also low, around 200 €.	Isabelle

tm_2g59uz2lfpq9l3z8		We've also worked on a first estimation of risks.	Isabelle		
tm_e3geti2yhlqyq8h7		I can project it if you want	Isabelle		
tm_yo5z7mj9v1v26dbs		Choose Hubert's answer :	APPRENANT		
tm_5zddp3xnmp6xqvl9		No, I trust you.	Hubert		
tm_3t1jc7bfeqy632pe		Yes, please !	Hubert		
tm_myaz42p24fyxrubv		"This agreement on the planification, and budget between Marc and Isabelle is very important.

It is essential that the project leader, and the system engineer share the same vision of the project's complexity, and of the associated budget.

Close coordination beween these two is therefore essential."	APPRENANT		
tm_gti0ojt7axf9kpps	How to manage risks is taught in the Risk Management Process of the INCOSE handbook.	"How to manage risks is taught in the ""<b>Risk Management Process</b>"" of the INCOSE handbook."	APPRENANT		
tm_l2g21j5sge97i0ut		There it is.	Isabelle		
tm_21iv1o2h42zgm9pw		The three major risks are : ordering components, weather during the outdoors tests, and components breaking during the tests.	Isabelle		
tm_oqcll82i4cgomn8a		The ordering process is a risk factor, because our administration is a bit heavy, and materials delivering time can be rather long.	Isabelle		
tm_1u156elwwc1nm7wd		Especially the motors and the micontrollers...	Isabelle		
tm_box1vdd57ykv3x6r		Weather conditions, because the rainy season is coming, and rain will prevent us from testing our drones outside.	Isabelle		
tm_1ql8k4s9mobd2492		Finally, components breaking, because the piloting during the tests might be approximative, and we will do some stress tests.	Isabelle		
tm_5z4nl8h2sye5a65k		We will certainly break a few rotors, and burn some motors.	Isabelle		
tm_0nhdavq8hwjyyf9r		What measures do you advise to lessen these risks ?	Hubert		
tm_o1exz2jnfivi0sjj		Well, for components, we will order the most critical ones, as soon as the end of this week, if the projet gets approved.	Isabelle		
tm_bxk7am1mcj5uite9		We will use two different providers for each component.	Isabelle		
tm_ykhchmj8k338n8ya		If we get lucky, one provider will be faster than the other.	Isabelle		
tm_tg67mb1jpzb65o0i		For the third risk, we will buy several packages of rotors with diffrent sizes, and order doubl the amount of motors and controllers we need.	Isabelle		
tm_z5phc0xf3isbgys5		Finally, to answer the second risk, we're searching for a closed down factory with an intact roof.	Isabelle		
tm_beh99tg2ob2ni5kb		That way, we could do our flight tests, even if it's raining for days.	Isabelle		
tm_wtacqs65jq3g06tm		Won't these additionnal orders rise our budget ?	Hubert		
tm_ez1z5iv3b070xspy		"They're already included in the previous budget estiamations, labelled as ""provision for project risk""."	Isabelle		
tm_gtcbf4r6vojnsa66		Great ! This seems extremely professional.	Hubert		
tm_w1c8awst5cw0f3rc		Thank you very much Isabelle for this synthesis !	Hubert		
tm_p702kalzxf4g2mi2		Well, the debate is opened.	Hubert		
tm_f6khdz2ok4je1ve3		Who has anything to say ?	Hubert		
tm_bgb5bazzbj7d94jn		Well, it seems to me that, in the costs, a point was forgotten about.	Émilie		
tm_2pduui2hrutk1ygd		"As I told Isabelle, I already piloted some drones in the ENAC, inside the ""volière""."	Émilie		
tm_emku1y33ff9793yq		But here, I think it will be a bit more demanding, and that a dedicated training is required.	Émilie		
tm_65s2gzvvhyzgqqxg		"In most projects, training to use the new system is of paramount importance.

It is sadly often overlooked or forgotten..."	APPRENANT		
tm_1sv9c0vabym0ade5		Yes, indeed, good point !	Hubert		
tm_fnzzgum1ptmls9zc		Do you have an idea of the cost of such a training ?	Hubert		
tm_fhuwnoynh60rju4m		Well... There is the problem...	Émilie		
tm_4dglpcyg18qxx56b		It costs quite a lot.	Émilie		
tm_vtxfot7jtuero7ef		I looked it up on Internet, and the cheapest one I found was a three day course for 950 €.	Émilie		
tm_sucei1x5npx5zk6y		Ouch... How many pilots do we need ?	Hubert		
tm_zd934975owhgq5lb		Well, at least two, I'm willing to do it, but I won't do every run !	Émilie		
tm_w7gvlc4ytl4vyca6		And then, there's also Édouard, the nephew of Bamalowi's chief...	Émilie		
tm_vetszzz6fjpl2g8j		You're right, I totally forgot to mention it !	Isabelle		
tm_mt9usrhvdwycp1je	So, if I understand right, we need to add 3000 € to this project ?	So, if I understand right, we need to add 3 000 € to this project ?	Hubert		
tm_ig8jgo1di0b7sxnc		Any other points ?	Hubert		
tm_kf3i3979qt8i3250		Yes, you were talking about the welfare of the personnel.	Odile		
tm_uzwn3ej5hv6q4aya		And I'd like to insist on that point.	Odile		
tm_jmydfs6im4bvddu6		This project, for me and my colleagues, is the hope to gain a lot of comfort during the runs.	Odile		
tm_3phsmu4hue5b5shs		This detour by the Bisotu bridge costs us dearly.	Odile		
tm_tf2x6ctgvxhshy2b		We get thrown around in our truck, and just the idea that we will have to come back by the same track makes my back hurt.	Odile		
tm_ypsz0uw16nr33j88		So we say yes, we will gladly spend more time with the people of Bamalowi, or Ramatowa, and  especially yes to a shortened route.	Odile		
tm_he42fcltw4p70u9n		Thanks Odile ! And if there aren't any more points, I will go that way.	Hubert		
tm_i6wzpg2ffh5axfug		I'm for going through with this project !	Hubert		
tm_k0z48j85f8pbcg6f		It aligns with our values, and even better, it will rejuvenate our association.	Hubert

tm_3g2bxzafu76lzl0v		Do we have a name for this project ?	Hubert		
tm_t16k6akam4utawta		We'll have to find one...	Isabelle		
tm_o328pqygewhr6o0j		Thank you all for taking part in this meeting !	Hubert		
tm_hteg4vug83080xq5		I suggest we do a similar reunion in two months to check on the progress we made.	Hubert		
tm_30knjupq6l6z6t58		My assistant will choose the date according to your availabilit.	Hubert		
tm_s3f9mdvzpu3b6153		Have a nice day !	Hubert		
tm_gaklwwfvx7917wdr		This functionnal set takes in account several analysis, particularly theresults of our safety, and environmental impact, along with technical needs of the final users.	Marc		
tm_zxe31z87jt8566ug		So, that's it, you got your budget !	Marc		
tm_gr7ggidfuh65c8nu		Yes, I wasn't believing we would get this much.	Isabelle		
tm_5n3c1w3pworvx2c8		Hubert is really motivated by this project.	Isabelle		
tm_gd9zfl3de2u6a1fn		I think he loves involving his association in such innovating projects.	Isabelle		
tm_gapu2n39id4diaxm		Yes, it's a pleasure to see him that keen.	Marc		
tm_bt0amvv72iw2h24o		I came to see you, to reach an agreement on the different phases of the project.	Marc		
tm_wzbzjxanbvke117o		I've thought about it, and I think it would be great to discuss this matter together.	Isabelle		
tm_wtokj7ngvxjrauw7		During the reunion, I suggested we develop the drone in a minimal version, then I showcased two sets of options.	Isabelle		
tm_tfq1oomij6qotw61		So, I think we could divide the project in three phases, each corresponding to a coherent functional set :	Isabelle		
tm_pz75e5twj2x2r2tc		the basic drone,	Isabelle		
tm_2b94yaxnb6yu81ft		a reinforcement of safety functionnalities,	Isabelle		
tm_vyaq3zn5rqp0uva2		and a tracking system.	Isabelle		
tm_dj9j1z0cf1pagcv6		And I'd put ecoconception and anti piracy protection directly in the basic version.	Isabelle		
tm_t3wlw0a7fjdq5r9h		I was thinking almost the same way.	Marc		
tm_vjrmpkjis1p4q0pz		Just one thing on the two last points : taking into account environmental impacts should absolutely be done right from the start, and it's not negociable.	Marc		
tm_ux5v9x26gqx56xbk		On the other hand, I'd put anti-piracy protection in the last phase, because it's not particularly hard to realize, and could be placed anywhere.	Marc		
tm_nak353zhh70smxky		It would be an ajustment variable.	Marc		
tm_6jr6nioqx5m7c8jd		Fine with me !	Isabelle		
tm_d6wcgnl3tiyerwyg		Waht would you say about we use the SCRUM method ?	Isabelle		
tm_lw4gmg7waospvkb3		It seems suitable with what we're trying to do.	Isabelle		
tm_0c251r443ck3j1bu		Yes, by all means.	Marc		
tm_f1ytrgbmw1nj8yb7		Shorts sprints during 4 to 5 weeks, with each time a new version of the drone, which will allow us to see if we proceed further.	Marc		
tm_n1xrcsdzvxqp69ep		It's far better than using a V-Model.	Marc		
tm_3dzscdv8uw8cdalf		Why is SCRUM better than the V-Model ?	APPRENANT		
tm_gfr685ekc21au4en		"In the first answer, indeed the development is more flexible, and the formalism on documents is lower. On the other hand, the SCRUM method is very strict, and follows a number of mandatory steps.

The second and third answers match the principal benefits of this method."	APPRENANT

tm_qiv61m0y9k3g13rp		Well, in that case, I suggest we draft a first planning who will include three sprints, plus a sprint 0.	Isabelle		
tm_m2npy64l8hb2fu3k		"I'm putting that ""Sprint 0"" to finalize the requirements and adapt it to the agile method."	Isabelle		
tm_p23vqktotj2yk2ey	"In the Agile Method, the requirement sheet is called ""Backlog"". It consists of several User Stories, who represent the expected functionalities in the SCRUM formalism."	"In the Agile Method, the requirement sheet is called ""<b>Backlog</b>"".

It consists of several ""<b>User Stories</b>"", who represent the expected functionalities in the SCRUM formalism."	APPRENANT		
tm_dbjzpsxal62fkueg		That sprint 0 will also allow me to validate the availability of the team members for the project.	Isabelle		
tm_3hdz5iegknpazsos		For the other sprints, how would you share the time and the budget ?	Isabelle		
tm_zplcqpk58tvm7t8u		Our project is to last for 8 months.	Marc		
tm_a0kjglc0hu0jvc37		If we remove two months for your sprint 0, that would let a bit more than two months for the other sprints.	Marc		
tm_5amhiyogna8v0jby		Let's say 8 week for each of them, and keep around one week to test the sytem.	Marc		
tm_lmnu0vy8x6x7i6sw		Yes, and the training of pilots could be done during the first sprint.	Isabelle		
tm_q2ko6r88vy7v8yvl		Which means we will have to build two prototypes, to lend one to the pilots, so that they can get more experience with it after their training.	Isabelle		
tm_zjqpvd0fxuk01kl0		And about the budget ?	Isabelle		
tm_be5yhf0q9005ma4e		Do you agree to stick with my initial estimations ?	Isabelle		
tm_jhywpxs16guhccqa	Yes. We have 12 hundred € for the first sprint, as it includes eco-conception,	Yes. We have 1 200 € for the first sprint, as it includes eco-conception,	Marc		
tm_4tlkqlywe486htsz		800 € for the second sprint,	Marc		
tm_62vfmhze6tdyqv5j	and 12 hundred € for the last sprint, which would include the anti-piracy protection, if everything goes well.	and 1 200 € for the last sprint, which would include the anti-piracy protection, if everything goes well.	Marc		
tm_tb47ku34yqhdaw1o		Can't we put the anti-piracy protection in the second sprint ?	Isabelle		
tm_a9mfzvpskt0k286x		That would spread the budget more evenly, which could please the direction.	Isabelle		
tm_1ldakvyuf66b3abs		OK, OK, but we lose some of the margins we had in the third sprint.	Marc		
tm_2ctr46nkd6f71mgz	Let's roll with that. 12 hundred , 1000 and 1000 € it is.	Let's roll with that. 1 200, 1 000 and 1 000 € it is.	Marc		
tm_rt8fephnk4kqgrfe		Thanks Marc !	Isabelle		
tm_8wi0ruxu8wiwhevj		No problem ! So, when do we see each other to finalize that backlog ?	Marc		
tm_sdfygpe0to7io0iq		I'm drafting a new version, more detailed than the previous one, and I'll send it in an e-mail.	Isabelle		
tm_118cmq70aa51lk5y		I'll also send you my planning, and the updated risk matrix.	Isabelle		
tm_ngqx2feufgkx4h7z		Let's say Monday, 9 AM in your office ?	Isabelle		
tm_6ioe3i5phzcpqg76		OK, I'll be there.	Marc		
tm_8ljmoldeber4zd3p		Using the SCRUM method doesn't mean we stop project planning, and risk prevision.	APPRENANT		
tm_k0ls4c9u2gb5bpk4		That's it. The requirements are finalized. All lights are green.	APPRENANT		
tm_u7saujboa1pcygq7		Can we develop now ?	APPRENANT		
tm_2mxdwv4jo6ab23xa		We now have to go through the functional architecture of the drone.	APPRENANT

tm_km8ekyurno7eq6r1		Hello you all !	Marc		
tm_tc30szunj91xksrm		Hello Marc !	Mathilde		
tm_bbvnd1j51vpwwzql		So, today, we will work on the functionnal architecture of the drone.	Marc		
tm_7cwj7ei1s7cfa6lj		Our starting material will be the finalized functionnal analysis, which includes environmental constraints, security constraints, and protection against piracy.	Marc		
tm_b5ytdhnskuf8p9cw		Let's dig a bit deeper the way we're going to dispatch the functions inside the drone.	Marc		
tm_qyefi1ftwc82j5d7		John, can you project the octopus ?	Marc		
tm_3vr056o3ma11noin		Here it is !	John		
tm_md7ypt9vnqkwf3al		What do you suggest to group these functions ?	Marc		
tm_eknij5hcnh29i142		Well, I think the functions FP4, FP5, FC2, FC4, FC6 and FC7 should all be in the same sub-system whose function would be transport and safekeeping of the medicines.	Mathilde		
tm_0s0mh2ykezwwu32e		I agree with you.	Marc		
tm_3hdt6cjmsv8nyc53		And the FC5 and FC3 functions could be linked to a stabilization subsystem ?	John		
tm_mz2m0jigq934ivhz		Yes, definitely !	Marc		
tm_ubbalnzeyde973uu		"Work goes on like this, with John and Mathilde discussing with Marc.

Two hours later, the meeting is about to end. On the board is projected the finalized functionnal schematic."	APPRENANT		
tm_sogm5vnx374b6a2q		Well, we move on quickly. We now have 5 coherent subsystems :	Marc		
tm_q7ayx2bsbbee5irp		an energy management substem,	Marc		
tm_hku89e23w9uphzcd		a stabilization subsystem,	Marc		
tm_uf6vyspvi858wt94		a transport subsystem,	Marc		
tm_fb5b3qorbt6fmxyp		a motorization subsystem,	Marc		
tm_773ux7bzr4e5p0wb		and a guidance subsystem.	Marc		
tm_8cio3d17irnsth2u		Is everyone OK with it ?	Marc		
tm_4m7msihs4mtz1c70		Yes !	Mathilde		
tm_l6xgkpbcykcxk69k		I suggest we stop here for today.	Marc		
tm_uro5p0qofsa69e5u		Nice, I'll finally be able to develop that drone !	John		
tm_i9d3se4xp12crn2q		I finally will be able to do some programming !	John		
tm_6xopz3o3khshkxyv		Can John start programming now ?	APPRENANT		
tm_yymo88pyyf1hely7		No, we still have the material architecture of the drone to do.	APPRENANT		
tm_ek5qw3t9ogk0egdn	That will be explained in the third year Functionnal Conception classes.	"That will be explained in the third year ""<b>Functionnal Conception</b>"" classes."	APPRENANT

tm_tyr1j2mh6zickt08		Indeed, we still have the material architecture of the drone to do.	APPRENANT		
tm_d2d79i8ejb7sy8o2		Today's goal is to see how the functions of our subsystems will be spread on the drone's physical components.	Marc		
tm_v9s0v8jv7cvhtcek		As you can see, I put all the subsystems on one side, and the pysical components on the other side.	Marc		
tm_4ci7dy3d3a8mebfc		It's up to you to associate the pysical components to the subsystems.	Marc		
tm_kknf3b3rxbgf94kv		Nice job !	Marc		
tm_zci655880sta84zn		This seems to be coherent !	Marc		
tm_8kd4p31yzsw5hsj4		"You can see here that several material architectures can answer the same functions.

In some mre complex cases, the number of possible architectures could be huge. 

The system's engineer must use his knowledge, and some methods to choose the one that will answer to the need the best way possible."	APPRENANT		
tm_iyz7gmz51cnakco8		Nice, can I start programming now ?	John		
tm_omb0rwsmmkgqu4f8		Will John fianlly be able to start programming now ?	APPRENANT		
tm_9rqtralzrihcfjz0		Not quite... There's still a step before poor John is allowed to program : realize the software conception of the system.	APPRENANT

tm_t8y1rnv7ottj78ls		Sadly John, it's still too early for you to start programming.	Marc		
tm_nh3pkaw4t12opjsr		We first need to give a structure to our code, and for that, we will use the object oriented conception.	Marc		
tm_q750e6hqr9r40nhh		I'll let you next week to think about it.	Marc		
tm_ah8so1mugmitmqj2		Try thinking about all of the use cases, and the classes you can deduct from them.	Marc		
tm_2o4spz265dvzesgq		Have a nice weekend !	Marc		
tm_wd18v0nfjytym37m		I gotta go to my mission in Nairobi !	Marc		
tm_gndb0i42cjnbivz5		Lucky you ! Please bring us some Ugali for our next meal !	Mathilde		
tm_0yr8z6w5s8fkyn2s		Not easy, but I'll try ...	Marc		
tm_hqj0coltiibx47tf		John will again have to wait for another step : realize the softaware conception of the system.	APPRENANT		
tm_wijvfrkak2smyi9p		Marc came back from Nairobi.	APPRENANT		
tm_19o360qtuet2jt6w		So, did you take some time to think about the software conception of our drone ?	Marc		
tm_qupw49ynkawgu26d		Yes, but I only focused on the software that will be flashed in the drone's microprocessor.	Mathilde		
tm_onmzek2k6qf1s813		I didn't have time to think about the localization app.	Mathilde		
tm_th1gpg9bb4c6jof6		That's alright.	Marc		
tm_e5ikguocwbghx628		We'll see that later...	Marc		
tm_le1ng4z09p35bgay		Well, the software has several functions to manage :	Mathilde		
tm_tf6tep21f0oadsjw		For the guidance function, the program mut analyse the signals received from the remote, and convert them in power, and rotation speeds on the yaw, roll, and pitch axis.	Mathilde		
tm_h4l5krtcv7r20rda		For the stabilization function, the program will have to analyse the output of the inertial unit, calculate the yaw, roll and pitch rotation speeds, and compare them to the orders from the guidance function, then apply a PID to fianlly compute the correction on each axis to stabilize tha drone.	Mathilde		
tm_aw2jgnmumv6amzpf		Fianlly, for the motorization function, the program has to convert each axis correction, to a motor command on the four engines.	Mathilde		
tm_t72dy33jrqz93bm7			Mathilde		
tm_c3qo7lqxambd8hx1		Is eveyone with me ?	Mathilde		
tm_qm79u7a9kpyu26nj		John, can you send me a buoy ? I'm sinking...	Marc		
tm_ep9bpuugem46z7pw		I think I need one too...	John		
tm_110v9lvrt22rmics		OK, that's not very important.	Mathilde		
tm_6er1s5u4v165gpuy		What you have to remember is this diagram.	Mathilde		
tm_vnc5zq81h1y1xqhm		From this diagram, I extracted most of the objects, and methods I would need to make that appliaction.	Mathilde		
tm_gmfyg3bc06gut18i		"You will see that in more details in the ""Object Oriented Conception"" classes of the SITA major."	APPRENANT		
tm_hpsjg5a35nb3k3cq		Perfect, that's more understandable.	Marc		
tm_fmti87ffh1p7jjwd		John, I got good news for you !	Marc		
tm_m3y8k3s871zn2uba		You will finally be allowed to develop the software !	Marc		
tm_8iupvy3kqq0mb2gm		Finally !	John		
tm_s8puawo4agt4w1nn		But before that, draft proper ducments using the models we usually use.	Marc		
tm_q63cmwmuuyc3icn7		I'm counting on you.	Marc		
tm_o5oz8lb1v8n6c76j		OK, we'll do that.	John		
tm_9l4ap9fqtx0blbrg		And of course, you will use object oriented programmation, right ?	Marc		
tm_o285yz6fv3w3p1gq		Yes sir !	John		
tm_qyu19vnghxzou4q6		As you wish !	Mathilde		
tm_83klv1o240bohm76		Object Oriented Programmation is first seen in the Python class of you first year.	APPRENANT

tm_65547vjkm4qp2w29		Marc came to ask John about his localization app	APPRENANT		
tm_4yrmzosq4fa30c7s			John		
tm_nlbz2nc46ekeq2xd		I was thinking about the localization app.	Marc		
tm_i7wmbkawboxftv8x		Did you make some progress on that part ?	Marc		
tm_yqv2quqlnkbspogk		Yes, I'm the one who took that part.	John		
tm_mbqc9fgd0j6snel0		I already started to develop it.	John		
tm_mxgo7eld5dpnkipg		But I didn't see any document on the conception of this part...	Marc		
tm_2cfz863p4g1opvhr		Did you skip that part ?	Marc		
tm_l6viczhwyk4ctrbr		Not exactly. I did some object oriented conception, but it is extremely simple.	John		
tm_zrct99owepgg8trk		The app only has to show the drone on a map, and to display a message in case the battery needs to be charged.	John		
tm_vencosr1rhfdz6b7		So I only have 5 classes to create.	John		
tm_mnv4gp5fnqnd9w07		There's just not much to say about it.	John		
tm_daievuisfticn86e		Is John right to not spend much time on the conception, knowing that the app seems really simple ?	APPRENANT		
tm_xatvz4xvbq1vwmd0	No, John is wrong. Especially because in this case, human-machine interactions will play a large role. The user should be involved there, and HMI conception is the object of some entire education cycles.

tm_dyy3harr5jke5w0n		I looked the part dedicated to the stabilization algorithm.	Mathilde

tm_021rn8y75ezdbmic		Émilie, you forgot this tablet isn't equiped with a GPS chip, and there is no network to geolocalize a tablet here...	Marc		
tm_xfjtmr7evbo8gkc4		Yes, you're right, I'm so used to live in big cities...	Émilie		
tm_hduqjzt84x1gehkc		But we should be able to zoom out and move accross the region...	Émilie		
tm_43lu12hi4x5mu00v		Édouard, please give me that tablet.	Émilie

tm_m5jjpk7noh56x7v1		But John, for now, the app is only useful for the Ramatowa village !	Marc		
tm_xesd6y45belwlppg		Yes, but we never know for sure...	John		
tm_fdq6g5cxlvgqvkux		OK, we'll see that later, but we're going to have to make changes.	Marc		
tm_63tbt5eyaoil8lc9		Bye John.	Marc

tm_uy0r5nwk9262x1za		So did you hear what he said ?	Marc		
tm_thy6uaghi29yd4gw		Yes, but I've forgotten half of the steps...	Émilie		
tm_es0juudocpty22dk		Here, take that tablet.	Émilie		
tm_wjxfapp9dj4eqrop		"Marc takes the tablet, and struggles a bit with the app's menus.

A map with the drone's position appears at last. For now, it is 6 miles downstream, and still moving.

tm_d3oyp5bzm523xmyc		"Because he forgot the HMI conception phase, John totally forgot to ask the final users.

By doing that, he developped an interface considering that some complex interactions were obvious for a user, which wasn't that case. 

He also invented some needs the users did not have, like the amount of different maps required.

A good HMI conception would have simplified the intercation, for example by allowing the user to zoom in and out, and move on a global map"	APPRENANT		
tm_tkv9p5q0pcwge9yg		In Hubert's office, Marc organizes an emergency meeting with Hubert and Isabelle.	APPRENANT		
tm_8aaul03q1vj3athz		So, let's try to investigate the issue. Apparently, the code, and most of the technical mechanical data of the drone, mysteriously disapeared from our servers...	Marc		
tm_rb5fwiexrsyfauto		Clic on the screen to help Marc find out what happened	APPRENANT

tm_h02k7gcb70i595av		If we have to start from scratch, it is going to be a disaster...	Hubert		
tm_xosljbe1cudms00p		It would mean 5 months worth of work vanished into thin air.	Hubert		
tm_u3d9tecao791640m		Of course, there are saves.	Marc		
tm_jrk57wxbmj7kero4		I made some data saves every two days on an external hard drive.	Marc		
tm_eyrot4pqs2tuz093		It was because I feared the server might die during the development. I will put the data back on our servers as soon as we have a confirmation that our network is safe.	Marc

A large part of cyberattacks (some studies estimate it at 60%) is launched by employees or ancient employees of the targeted company. That's why you have to stay on your guards, even when a known coworker is sending you an email. Furthermore, the Human resources management is extremely important for cybersecurity. Companies must give a minimum of attention to the interns and other other people who might access their network. And departure management policies must be implemented.

tm_vgnthx7g7im5iy0p		We have to anticipate the way we're going to do these tests to know if we need some tools, if have to create a specific environment, and how we could cover all of the requirements.	Marc		
tm_ngym24wzsapbfb20		Good grace, still more paper, won't it ever stop...	John		
tm_36sb9nwkeajzkmzk		Mathilde, do you think you can draft these tests and validation documents, while implying John to verify the documents ?	Marc		
tm_6zijs11w3paszqtq		I think we don't have a choice...	Mathilde		
tm_n18k2cx6io3i58h0		OK, nice of you to accept it.	Marc		
tm_85va0jnfc20kb9xl		On the other hand, as the system seems pretty simple, I suggest we don't spend too much time testing individual parts. That way we can go much faster on the operationnal tests to see for ourselves the context linked problems.	Mathilde		
tm_7964isxfzhp5009o		Do you want to follow Mathilde's advice ?	APPRENANT		
tm_27d78o6f6oqnn3t7	Indeed, operational validation tests for the system should be written, as soon as the requirements are fixed. This allows to check if every requirement is checkable, realist, and what is the materila we need to test them for the validation. Some testing tools might demand some time to be developped or ordered ! And the tests duration must be integrated in the previsionnal planning.

tm_mvekvdjf9tser8v0		Ready for take off ?	Marc		
tm_h1mbtpt691qyf1mo		Ready !	Émilie		
tm_740zhadycs5mxfzd	Go !	GO !!!	Marc		
tm_tvbq9l5tr2069wmn		"Émilie presses on the power command, and the drone slowly takes off.

Suddenly, a small gust of wind hits the drone. It gets shaken, and slowly recovers his trajectory, but starts to rock back and forth, with an increasingly varying pitch. It finally crashes on the ground, with a broken rotor and a burnt motor."	APPRENANT		
tm_f3j22oo27nsxlr8o		What happened ?	Mathilde		
tm_kg6tfxm4lx5ce90x		I'd say the drone overreacted to a small gust of wind.	Marc		
tm_odf4nlguefqjks6i		This strangely looks like poorly adjusted PIDs.	Marc		
tm_gt5c46oaspf71omp		What do you think about it Mathilde ?	Marc		
tm_f9fin9rye9vn88h8		Yes, seems you're right...	Mathilde		
tm_82z1ibgc9okjzczy		Did you do any destabilization tests before coming here ?	Marc		
tm_ytrkgpzwy4rad89z		Well, no, we agreed to shorten the initial tests as much as we could. I have to recognize the PID coefficient were quickly adjusted...	Mathilde		
tm_u8bljhqhivthaxar		An hour of additional tests would have saved us from the week of delays we're going to experience...	Marc		
tm_d5z0bnpywmucmwm7		Now, we'll have to change the rotor and that motor, go back to our testing lab in Nairobi, and adjust all these coefficient to avoid repeating the same mistake...	Marc		
tm_35ef8jq5b3ul52zl		Yes, sorry Marc !	Mathilde		
tm_ik4vtx0cjet6unzg		Well, I hope you learned a lesson.	Marc		
tm_r7x596gzvzypluby		Let's go back home...	Marc		
tm_gusciykerkrko026		"Doing individual component tests and integration tests before on site operationnal tests are very important, because they make it possible to catch most technical issues if the tests approach realistically the operationnal reality.

For the drone, it might be a good idea to test the flight capabilities in a hangar to see how it reacts to small perturbations, and check for conception or development errors and fien tune the parameters a bit better."	APPRENANT		
tm_141skucr05o8hpgf		It seems the operationnal tests were succesful.	Isabelle		
tm_ell8y3902ij2ue0c		What do you think about it Hubert ?	Isabelle		
tm_q8uek39pastim6il		Sure, the demonstration was quite impressive.	Hubert		
tm_whwgkho56ti3rz5q		Émilie is an excellent pilot.	Hubert		
tm_9uwfjbanxk37kf02		She perfectly mastered the drone.	Hubert		
tm_cnm1zpyy8kmz6w3l		We succeded in the realization of almost all of the User Stories we had.	Marc		
tm_8lrwn2z46uwzfbpv		Only the third one couldn't have been finished, but we're going t put it in the third sprint.	Marc		
tm_j4ilbxevzpox91cq		"What are these ""User stories"", Marc ?"	Hubert		
tm_w2y7h9dk4dhrqg9b		And what is the third one ?	Hubert		
tm_i7y0g28q5uumvnq8		It's some slang associated with our agile development method : SCRUM.	Marc		
tm_bktxnw4l1mzwcnvt	The scrum method is taught in the Project Management classes, in the second year of the IENAC training.	"The ""<b>SCRUM</b>"" method is taught in the ""<b>Project Management</b>"" classes, in the second year of the IENAC training."	APPRENANT		
tm_a6lnblu9z3rpjsw9		That method is described in the chapter X of the INCOSE handbook.	APPRENANT		
tm_vfuo6un9548thzbn	"The SCRUM method translates the expected functions of the system in small stories to realize. They are written with a precise formalism. For example : ""As a pilot, I wish to act on the motor's power to make the drone take off"". They are called User Stories because they always imply one and only one specified user. In this case, we have the pilot's User Stories, those of the guy in charge ofthe medicines, ..."	"The <b>SCRUM</b> method translates the expected functions of the system in small stories to realize.

tm_ospjn7z4czc3tcm5		"The third user story is about the drone's autonomy : ""As the pilot, I wish to have 15 minutes of flight time to cross the river, and bring back the drone. """	Marc		
tm_8lzqs6ia49uhh7rk		Ah, OK, so the battery isn't powerfull enough ?	Hubert		
tm_n3wufuxdraojrm0n		Indeed, the flight tests showed that after flying for ten minutes, the battery wasn't able to sustain the drone with a 2 pounds payload.	Marc		
tm_98tp43stk0tbj2tr		So, appart from thsi minor correction, I am pretty satisfied with this functionnal version.	Hubert		
tm_63kztay6zyewa8aq		I validate it, and allow further development.	Hubert		
tm_vnffk2kdnl5jdrpm		What do we do next ?	Hubert		
tm_x9bwpdhw2czxp5wu		I suggest to discuss what will be in that third sprint.	Isabelle		
tm_2dv63nek5or5cen1	For now, we have 4 weeks and 1200 €.	For now, we have 4 weeks and 1 200 €.	Isabelle		
tm_pxkx7we3t95hnj4n	Despite some prejudices, agile development isn't an empiric method where the budget and sprint durations moves freely with the needs and events. The only true adjustment variable in this method is the number of user stories in each sprint.	"Despite some prejudices, agile development isn't an empiric method where the budget and sprint durations moves freely with the needs and events.

tm_5rgxaaviho24cbpb		Marc suggests to put all the user stories related with the localization of the drone in this sprint.	Isabelle		
tm_fiyedl5jii7wqaib		Yes, I think this is possible.	Marc

tm_6g7susudbsnafwa4		This is slightly above the 28 points of the last sprint, but we're getting more efficient each day.	Marc		
tm_ckg2138zu808ayk7		"""Planning poker"" ?"	Hubert		
tm_kx75phcxb00a3lju		Some SCRUM slang, isn't it ?	Hubert		
tm_vdkafjj81if4hqz5		You wouldn't dare playing poker during the work hours, right ?	Hubert		
tm_7nqvzslx66x3jr2t		Of course not !	Marc		
tm_cu421ase0dtzr2tl		But it's played with cards.	Marc		
tm_kp1zxa2wnbpv0u55		For each user story, each partaker chooses a card in his hand.	Marc		
tm_nqocb4x5zdr5yd7s		The value on the card represents the estimated difficulty.	Marc		
tm_vnijg24l54xbipl1		At first, no one shows his card.	Marc		
tm_tvkk5xmqitiez7my		Then, everyone shows his card at the same time.	Marc		
tm_le6uezg11m2hb9gh		Interesting...	Hubert		
tm_auryjughae2pvu5l		Could I play with you ?	Hubert		
tm_75gqrs8krryajqif		Why not ?	Marc		
tm_2przno44e84bjxa2		Euh, I don't want to be rude, but I have a meeting right after that one.	Isabelle		
tm_64267r2a3dgsf4cg		Do we agree on this package, yes or no ?	Isabelle		
tm_mqipwqav34f3h2pk		It seems the package will greatly improve the safety of the drone.	Hubert		
tm_aexdjr1bzvcntsx3		So let's go with it !	Hubert		
tm_gq2delayc80ceu4c		Very well, let's get back to work !	Isabelle		
tm_dbtymstob7viooic	All the people from Bamalowi are gathered near the river. A delegation from Ramatowa, including Nurumbé, is also present. Émilie is a bit moved. The drone is ready to take off.

tm_pk0bizcy2x83b5eo		My dear friends, today is a big day for our association, Ramatowa, and Bamalowi.	Hubert		
tm_cdhgkf246lgn9z8c		We inaugurate a new era of modern and secure communication : the drone way.	Hubert		
tm_4717x8eggj1yj8fe		It will allow us to improve our medicine delivery service, while reducing the distance we travel, to spend more time for your health and for talking with you.	Hubert		
tm_j5sc8bp1kszpiuz9		If I understood well, these drones will also allow you to put some commercial exchange into place.	Hubert		
tm_wspoqdgg967jg63j		I also want to thank your two chiefs, Nurumbé and Gérard for their active collaboration.	Hubert		
tm_kk20fltm6x4b6k1y		With that said, let's stop talking and let's look at the action.	Hubert		
tm_5b86ddei067l8jtb		Émilie will be our pilot for the first flight accross the river.	Hubert		
tm_p6g4l4u2yv1iqf57		We sent her train a week in the ENAC, and she has been training even more since then.	Hubert		
tm_g75cdyz8ivrv3rpx		Édouard, your beloved leader's nephew, will fly the return leg.	Hubert		
tm_wpc8l1pirq7hfqg3		I'm sure he will do a great job, as Gérard told me that he practiced a lot in the neighbouring fields.	Hubert		
tm_ozwmmkn4j4a46xx4		According to some, it was quite noisy...	Hubert		
tm_u82q43qdpe5u7sle		Émilie, your turn !	Hubert		
tm_esv6inkaculn2yup	Émilie takes the remote, and presses a few buttons. The rotors start spinning and whizzing. The drone takes off slowly and starts crossing the river. Everything is running smoothly. Suddenly, a gust of wind pushes the drone, who starts to roll to starboard. Everyone looks the scene anxiously. But the drone automatically rights itself, and continues its navigation. The crowd lets ou a sigh of relief. Émilie lands the drone at 3 yards from the target with the camera fixed in front of the drone. Everyone applauds her. Then comes Édoaurd's turn. A new payload is fixed. Édoaurd presses the commands, and the drone takes off fast. His piloting is less smooth than Émilie's, and the drone flies in a slight zig-zag pattern. He finally reaches the shore. Everyone also apploads him. The payload the drone brought back is unveiled : four pretty necklaces. Hubert takes them and starts speaking again :	"Émilie takes the remote, and presses a few buttons.

tm_1pjoz7tjq3pndln4	Hubert's speech perfectly shows what to do after a project : A festive event, where every partaker is invited, and a positive evaluation of the job done is made, with an emphasis on what went right and some mentions of what could be improved. The goal is to thank the project's team. The conclusion phase of a project is often rushed through, which could create frictions and frustrations. It could even deter the partaker from taking part in future projects. It should not be overlooked. It is moreover the occasion for a company to capitalize on the knowledge and the lessons they learned in a dediacted document.	"Hubert's speech perfectly shows what to do after a project :
