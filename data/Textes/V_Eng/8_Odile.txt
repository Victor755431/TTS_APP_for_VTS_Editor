tm_l70e9wcw9kqvwd2f		Yes, the Ramatowa village, right accross Pamalowi !	Odile		
tm_qvg1wu77jhi3z7oz		Come on, tell us !	Odile		
tm_xbmj2te4r91v4mey		Is Marc also onboard ?	Odile		
tm_afnjzu09s4gn1wy8		Yes, and maybe a bit more.	Odile		
tm_fby7smv9dhbq5tbe		My concern is that the drone must be resistant, because the road is far from calm.	Odile		
tm_o7h080q9onsxqdbr		I'd say it's often like a rodeo !	Odile		
tm_21qk09evc1x0pkxs		Definitely yes !	Odile		
tm_qwn0fj7ie2q22fv5		Do you think we're not going to take an opportunity to avoid 40 miles of track, and 3 hours of tiring driving ?	Odile		
tm_gx0pe4i4xwqevl5w		What is this little stuff ?	Odile		
tm_zaxzwu44xqk82egj		Well, that's going to make our run a bit more interesting. I'm curious about what that show will look like !	Odile		
tm_kf3i3979qt8i3250		Yes, you were talking about the welfare of the personnel.	Odile		
tm_uzwn3ej5hv6q4aya		And I'd like to insist on that point.	Odile		
tm_jmydfs6im4bvddu6		This project, for me and my colleagues, is the hope to gain a lot of comfort during the runs.	Odile		
tm_3phsmu4hue5b5shs		This detour by the Bisotu bridge costs us dearly.	Odile		
tm_tf2x6ctgvxhshy2b		We get thrown around in our truck, and just the idea that we will have to come back by the same track makes my back hurt.	Odile		
tm_ypsz0uw16nr33j88		So we say yes, we will gladly spend more time with the people of Bamalowi, or Ramatowa, and  especially yes to a shortened route.	Odile
